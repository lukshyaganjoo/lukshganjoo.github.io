# how do humans work?
What does it mean to feel? Is it perhaps a synaptic reaction that governs your behaviour towards others? Or does it have its roots in the atavistic realm of human psychology?
Setting out on the thought process behind why people feel and how it affects their lives, is no mundane task and is unironically paradoxical. 

To think is to feel and to feel is to what we hope to find a meaning for. Life is perhaps the strangest journey I've ever encountered, there never seems to be a linear progression between your present self and the future you choose to acheive. An interconnected hive of experiences, events that all tie into this beautiful labyrinth , that we could only hope to understand. 

The smallest things, a seemingly trivial choice is what ends up changing a person's life. Yet, in every decision we make, trivial or perhaps life altering, an underlying philosophy is the rationale of feeling. How we choose to treat the other, the actions we take in life and our general perspective of the world and our place in it altogether. It's a rather strange to describe, how this ties in to everything for we cannot possibly comprehend it's sheer complexity. Yet we know of it's existence, a seemingly simple catalyst, the effects of which we are unclear on. 

Love, hatred, joy, guilt, envy, anger and regret. Seemingly different compositions of the very same feeling that resides in us. An allusion to the building blocks of life that make up the entire universe. Is the universe ever so lazy for such realities to be mere coincidence, or is there something we lie unaware of, the origin of feeling in mankind, how the hunter grew to care for the living beings he hunted, how he found his way in the sea of morality. 

Does it define our growth, of how we seem to discern between right and wrong, as the gradual realisation sinks in of the purpose of our actions. Is it the reason as to do what we do, or are our actions instead the cause of how we feel.

It is one of life's most confounding trivialities, one that I cannot yet seem to comprehend. Ironic really, since that thought gives me the most solace.
